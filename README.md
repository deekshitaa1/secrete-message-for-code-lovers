# secrete-message-for-code-lovers
Day 05 — Frontend Dev: Added a tiny secret-code demo (Redmi theme). For coders who ❤️ coding — keep shipping!
A small 3D-style secret message card that looks like a Redmi Note lock screen, with floating hearts and a hidden message saying

💌 “From my Redmi Note — I ❤️ Coding forever!”

When you click Unlock, it reveals the message beautifully — white message box, smooth 3D lighting, non-overlapping animation, and pro finish.
